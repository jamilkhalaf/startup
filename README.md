> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

Bring the nostalgia of Pacman into the modern era with our real-time gaming platform! Users can log in, play a fast-paced Pacman game, and compete for top spots on a dynamic leaderboard. Our platform is lightweight, interactive, and perfect for casual gamers who love a challenge.

### Key features

- Login/Logout System: Allow users to register, log in securely, and view their profile.
- Pacman Game: A fun and interactive browser-based game with animated gameplay.
- Leaderboard: A database-powered leaderboard that displays scores of all players and updates in real time.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Structure the website, including:
                *** A login page.
                - The game page with the Pacman interface.
                - The leaderboard page showing user rankings.
- **CSS** - Style the website for a clean and responsive look:
                - Themed styling for the game (e.g., a retro Pacman aesthetic).
                - Responsive design for desktop and mobile users.
                - Animations for transitions, button presses, and the game itself.
- **React** - Build a single-page application with React for:
                - Component-based architecture (e.g., Login, Game, Leaderboard components).
                - Routing between views (e.g., Login â†’ Game â†’ Leaderboard).
                - Reactive updates to the leaderboard and game state.
- **Service** - Backend endpoints to:
                - Authenticate users (login/logout).
                - Save and retrieve scores for the leaderboard.
                - Fetch scores from an external public API (e.g., use the Dog API to display a random image for fun when a game ends).
- **DB/Login** - User registration and login system:
                - Securely store hashed passwords in a database.
                - Display the logged-in user's name on the game and leaderboard pages.
                - Tables for users (e.g., username, password hash).
                - Tables for scores (e.g., user ID, score, timestamp).
- **WebSocket** - Enable real-time updates:
                - Broadcast leaderboard updates whenever a new score is submitted.
                - Optional: Broadcast live player stats during gameplay (e.g., "User123 is playing Pacman now!").
