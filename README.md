> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features

### Elevator pitch

Bring the nostalgia of Pacman into the modern era with our real-time gaming platform! Users can log in, play a fast-paced Pacman game, and compete for top spots on a dynamic leaderboard. Our platform is lightweight, interactive, and perfect for casual gamers who love a challenge.

### Design

![Design image](placeholder.png)

The Login Page includes fields for entering a username and password. A "Login" button redirects authenticated users to the Game page. Additionally, there is an optional "Sign Up" button for new users to register an account.

The Game Page features the Memory game interface. Users can click a "Start Game" button to initialize the game. Player statistics, such as the current score and time elapsed, are displayed either on the side or at the top of the screen. A "Restart Game" button is provided to navigate to the Leaderboard page.

The Leaderboard Page displays a table of high scores for all users, with the logged-in user's rank and score highlighted in the list. This page also includes a "Play Again" button to allow users to return to the Game page. For added fun, an image fetched from the external Dog API is displayed whenever a game ends.

### Key features

- Login/Logout System: Allow users to register, log in securely, and view their profile.
- Memory Game: A fun and interactive browser-based game with animated gameplay.
- Leaderboard: A database-powered leaderboard that displays scores of all players and updates in real time.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - I will use HTML to structure the website, including creating a login page for user authentication, a game page to display the memory interface, and a leaderboard page to show user rankings.
- **CSS** - CSS will be used to style the website, ensuring a clean and responsive look. I will apply a retro memory aesthetic using themed colors and designs, make the layout responsive for both desktop and mobile users, and incorporate animations for transitions, button interactions, and gameplay elements.
- **React** - React will serve as the framework for building a single-page application. I will use a component-based architecture to divide the application into reusable parts, such as the Login, Game, and Leaderboard components. React will also handle routing between pages and provide reactive updates to the leaderboard and game state.
- **Service** - The backend services will handle essential functions, including user authentication (login and logout), saving and retrieving scores for the leaderboard, and interacting with an external API, such as the Dog API, to fetch random images for fun after a game ends.
- **DB/Login** - A database will store user information and scores. I will securely store hashed passwords in the database, display the logged-in userâ€™s name on the game and leaderboard pages, and organize the data into tables for users (e.g., username and password hash) and scores (e.g., user ID, score, and timestamp).
- **WebSocket** - I will use WebSockets to enable real-time communication. This will include broadcasting leaderboard updates whenever a new score is submitted. Optionally, I will also broadcast live player activity, such as notifying others when a user starts playing the memory game.
